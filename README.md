Dry Electrodes – no gel needed (As an example, I used this one - [link](https://pieeg.com/cap-eeg-kit/)  
You can adjust the strength of the connection between the electrodes and the skin through the straps.

# Assembling 
For final assembly, you'll need bolts, washers, and nuts. Also, a belt. Details on what you need and the dimensions are in the video (above) or in the folder with presentation.  

#Materssila for 3D printer 
TPU  or PLA
So Flexible is good. But take into mind that during printing 

# Final 
I'm sure the flexible material is very good, but you see, you need to provide support during printing, which is difficult.  
A rigid material is more difficult to adjust so the electrodes touch the skin.
