# Free_3D_Printable_Headset
A fully open, 3D-printable EEG headset for ironbci from PiEEG — designed for DIY neuroscience, education, and BCI experiments.
Originaly design was created for ironbci BCI. You can adapt it for  your needs if necessary

# Generally     
I believe the headset is ready, but some work is needed to start, cables, connect the electrodes, and attach the battery from your side. Looks like better to use a 200 mA battery, not more, to ensure there's enough room inside the headset.  


Dry Electrodes – no gel needed (As an example, I used this one - [link](https://pieeg.com/cap-eeg-kit/)  
You can adjust the strength of the connection between the electrodes and the skin through the straps.

# Assembling 
For final assembly, you'll need bolts, washers, and nuts. Also, a belt. Details on what you need and the dimensions are in the video (above) or in the folder with the presentation.  

#Materssila for 3D printer 
TPU  or PLA
So Flexible is good. But take into mind that during printing 

# Final 
I'm sure the flexible material is very good, but you see, you need to provide support during printing, which is difficult.  
A rigid material is more difficult to adjust so the electrodes touch the skin.

These parts are used to cover the area with cables from electrodes to the brain-computer interface

Electrode connections. On one side Electrode, on the other side, the cable and electrode clamp.   
As you can see in this photo, I used flexible printing material. But I forgot to use the flexible support, and the edges came off a little.
