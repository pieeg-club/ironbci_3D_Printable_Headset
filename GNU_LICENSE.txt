Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing the title is not allowed (ironbci headset).

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.


To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the sources, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a sources, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code (Blender).  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the sources (Blender), and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.
